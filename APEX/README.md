## What APEX can do ?
- APEX can be used to stop a functionality to an action, or to add more functionality. but it can't modify standard salesforce functionality.


<br/>

## What APEX can not do ?
- APEX executes, exist only on the servers of force.com and not on client or developer system.
- APEX can't modify standard salesforce functionality. 
- there is no standard input and output, generally, Record and field values are taken as input from Objects and Output is the result that is reflected from from operations that are performed using APEX.
- apex does not create temp files so no need to worry about file handling.
- apex does not allow multi-threading.
- as everything exist on servers of force.com , hence no need of managing environment or upgrading developer tools.

***tip ðŸ’¡ :*** salesforce has a solution for almost any functionality you can think. so, Only Use APEX if the functionality can not be implemented using declarative approach("i.e using point and click tools").
