## why use salesforce ?

### what is CRM ?

### how was data managed back then with-out CRM ?
it was done manually and stored in files.
Gradually, with the advent of computers companies stored and accessed their data using word documents and excel sheets. 
However, as data started growing, this failed to serve the purpose.
this approach was in-efficient for handling large amount of data.

there was a requirement to store and analyze data in an effective way to improve customer Satisfaction.
hence, _came the CRM systems for the rescue._

initially these CRM solutions were hosted on the company's own server.
that proved to be costly and ineffective for the small companies or startups.


hence, there was a need for an affordable and easy to use CRM software accessible from anywhere using web.
this idea gave rise to Salesforce
